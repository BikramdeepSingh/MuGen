## Steps in ML Project
* **Import the Data** (most commomly used format is csv. If a database is containing your data, export that data in a csv file. Data sets can even be searched on kaggle.com )
* **Clean the Data** (Removing duplicate or unnecessary data which may lead to wrong result)
* **Split the Data into Training/Test Sets** (One for training the model and other for testing it. For exmaple 80% data for training the model and 20% for testing the model.)
* **Create a Model** (Selecting a algorithm for analysing the data. There are multiple machine learning algorithms such as decision tress, neural networks, etc. Choice of algoritm depends on the kind of problem that is to be solved.)
* **Train the Model** (Feed the training data and model will look for patterns in the training data which can be used to make predictions. Prediction is not always accurate.)
* **Evaluate and Improve** (Evalute the predictions and measure their accuracy. So, that required changes can be made in algo or a new algo can be implemented.)
## ML Libraries

* ***Numpy*** (provides a multi-dimensional array)
* ***Pandas*** (data analysis library that provides a concept called data frames. Data frame is a 2D data structure similar to an excel spreadsheet.)
* ***MatPlotLib*** (2D plotting lib for creating plots and graphs)
* ***SciKit-Learn*** (Provides all the common algos such as DecisionTrees, NeuralNetworks, etc.)
## Environment

Most common environment for ML projects is Jupyter for writing the code.
Frequently inspection of data is easy in Jupyter as compared to VSCode and 
Terminal.
## Jupyter Installation

1. anaconda.com/download
2. Download anaconda for python 
3. Install it. (It will install Jupyter as well as all the popular Data Science Libraries like Numpy, Pandas, etc.)
4. Skip installing Microsoft VSCode if you already have it on your system.
5. Open a terminal window and type jupyter notebook. (This will start the notebook server on your system.)
6. A browser window opens up pointing to localhost:8888/tree or also known as jupyter dashboard. Files tab points to the home directory of your system.
7. Somewhere on your machine create your jupyter notebook. By clicking on New->Python.
8. Change the name of the notebook from untitled to something meaningful.
9. Extension of a jupyter notebook is .ipynb. (Similar to .py files but contains additional data that jupyter uses to execute the code.)
